Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Containers package an application and its dependencies in a way that allows it to run consistently across different computing environments.

Key features of Kubernetes include:

Container Orchestration: It automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. Kubernetes works with popular container technologies like Docker.

Scaling: Kubernetes can scale applications up or down based on demand automatically. This ensures that resources are efficiently utilized.

Self-Healing: If a container fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it and ensures the desired number of containers are running at all times.

Service Discovery and Load Balancing: Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery and load balancing features to distribute network traffic to ensure that your applications are stable and responsive.

Storage Orchestration: Kubernetes allows you to mount different storage systems (local, cloud, network) to containers.

Declarative Configuration: Kubernetes allows you to define the desired state of your application infrastructure using declarative configurations, which means the platform will work to match the real state with the desired state.

Kubernetes is widely used for managing microservices architectures, allowing organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications at scale, both on-premise and in the cloud.

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Containers bundle an application with its dependencies, making it portable across different environments. Kubernetes helps manage these containers by:

Orchestrating the deployment and scaling of containers
Balancing loads and distributing network traffic
Self-healing by restarting or replacing failed containers
Managing storage and resources efficiently
K8s simplifies managing complex, large-scale applications, particularly those using microservices, across various environments, whether on-premises or in the cloud.
